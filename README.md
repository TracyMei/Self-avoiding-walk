# Self-Avoiding Walks (SAW) Simulation

## Introduction
This project simulates self-avoiding walks (SAW) on different types of lattices. SAWs are used to model the physical behavior of polymers.

## Features
- Simulates SAWs on a 2D square lattice
- Visualizes the walk using animations
- Easily extendable to other types of lattices
