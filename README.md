# Self-Avoiding Walks (SAW) Simulation

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts to simulate Self-Avoiding Walks (SAW) on hexagonal and square lattice structures. SAW is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computational physics, representing a path on a lattice where no point is visited more than once.

### Key Concepts
In mathematics, a SAW is defined as a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not revisit any point. This path is crucial in graph theory and has applications in modeling polymers and protein structures.

#### Properties and Applications
SAWs and Self-Avoiding Polygons (SAPs), closed SAWs, play a significant role in understanding the topological properties of molecules like proteins. They are fractals, exhibiting specific dimensions in different dimensions of space (d).

#### Computational Techniques
Due to the complexity of calculating SAW properties analytically, numerical simulations are essential. Techniques like the pivot algorithm are used for Monte Carlo simulations to generate SAWs efficiently.

#### Universality
SAWs exhibit universality, where macroscopic properties are independent of microscopic details like lattice structure. The connective constant Î¼, defining growth rates of SAWs, varies with lattice type and is a critical concept in statistical physics.

```

The visualization of the SAW path on square lattice/hexagonal lattice will appear.

## Explanation of Algorithms
### Square SAW Algorithm (Square_SAW.py)
- Lattice Initialization (_initialize_grid method): Initializes a square lattice grid with vertices.

- SAW Generation (_start_saw and _generate_saw methods): Begins from a randomly chosen vertex and extends the path using a random walk algorithm. Ensures each step avoids revisiting previous vertices.

- Visualization (visualize method): Uses matplotlib to animate and display the SAW path on the square lattice.

- Final Path Length (_show_final_path_length method): Prints the total length of the generated SAW path.

### Hexagonal SAW Algorithm (Hex_SAW.py)
- Lattice Initialization (_initialize_grid method): Initializes a hexagonal lattice grid with vertices using geometric calculations for hexagons.

- SAW Generation (_start_saw and _generate_saw methods): Starts from a randomly chosen vertex and extends the path using a random walk algorithm. Improves efficiency by leveraging the geometry of hexagons to reduce redundant checks, compared to the square lattice.

- Visualization (visualize method): Animates and displays the SAW path on the hexagonal lattice using matplotlib.

- Final Path Length (_show_final_path_length method): Outputs the total length of the generated SAW path.

### Algorithmic Advantages of Hexagonal Lattice
- Geometry Utilization: Hexagonal lattice structure naturally reduces the number of neighboring checks (compared to square lattice), improving computational efficiency.

- Reduced Redundancy: By utilizing hexagon geometry in _get_neighbors method, redundant checks for adjacent vertices are minimized, enhancing performance especially for larger grids.

- Visual Aesthetics: The hexagonal lattice visually complements the fractal nature of SAWs better than the square lattice, providing a more intuitive representation of the path.
